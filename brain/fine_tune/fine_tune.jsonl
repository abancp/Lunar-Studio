Mitochondria have their own DNA and likely evolved from symbiotic bacteria.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\n- Use information from SEARCH RESULTS\n- Synthesize clearly\n- If results don't contain the answer, respond normally\n- Do NOT call search() again\n- Cite relevant result numbers when appropriate\n", "response": "**Role of Mitochondria**\nMitochondria are called the **“powerhouse of the cell”** because they **produce ATP (energy)** (ref: 1).\n\n**How?**\n- Through **aerobic respiration**: break down **glucose + oxygen → CO₂ + H₂O + ATP** (ref: 2)\n\n**Unique Features:**\n- Contain **their own DNA**\n- Believed to originate from **ancient bacteria** that merged with early cells (endosymbiosis) (ref: 3)\n\n**Why it matters:** Without mitochondria, complex life (like humans) couldn’t exist."}

The Cold War (1947–1991) was a geopolitical rivalry between the US (capitalist) and USSR (communist) without direct warfare.\n2.
