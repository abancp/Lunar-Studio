{"prompt": "A farmer has 15 sheep and all but 8 die. How many are left?", "completion": "## Overview\nThis is a logic-based word problem that tests the understanding of the phrase \"all but.\" It's not a straightforward subtraction problem.\n\n## Key Concepts\n- Interpreting ambiguous phrasing in word problems.\n- Logical reasoning over pure calculation.\n\n## Step-by-Step Explanation\n1. The phrase \"all but 8 die\" means that everything except for 8 individuals perished.\n2. Therefore, if we start with 15 sheep, the number that died is \"all but 8,\" which is 15 - 8 = 7.\n3. However, the question asks for how many are *left*. The ones left are the ones that did *not* die.\n4. According to the phrase, the ones that did not die are the \"all but\" group, which is 8.\n\n## Example\nIf you have 10 apples and all but 3 rot, then the number of apples that are still good is 3.\n\n## Summary\nThe key is to understand that \"all but X\" means \"everything except for X.\" Therefore, the number of sheep left is 8."}
{"prompt": "Solve for x: 3(x + 5) = 36", "completion": "## Overview\nThis is a basic algebra problem requiring the application of the distributive property and inverse operations to isolate the variable.\n\n## Key Concepts\n- Distributive Property: a(b + c) = ab + ac.\n- Inverse Operations: Using division to undo multiplication and subtraction to undo addition.\n\n## Step-by-Step Explanation\n1. Apply the distributive property to the left side of the equation: 3 * x + 3 * 5 = 36, which simplifies to 3x + 15 = 36.\n2. Isolate the term with the variable by subtracting 15 from both sides: 3x + 15 - 15 = 36 - 15, which simplifies to 3x = 21.\n3. Solve for x by dividing both sides by 3: 3x / 3 = 21 / 3, which gives x = 7.\n\n## Example\nA similar problem: 2(y - 4) = 10. First, distribute: 2y - 8 = 10. Then add 8: 2y = 18.

The slope represents the steepness and direction of the line.\n\n## Key Concepts\n- Slope (m) = (Change in y) / (Change in x) = (y₂ - y₁) / (x₂ - x₁).\n- This is often referred to as \"rise over run.\"\n- The order of points must be consistent. If you subtract y₁ from y₂ in the numerator, you must subtract x₁ from x₂ in the denominator.\n\n## Step-by-Step Explanation\n1. **Label the points:**\n   - Let (x₁, y₁) = (1, 2)\n   - Let (x₂, y₂) = (4, 8)\n\n2. **Apply the slope formula:**\n   - m = (y₂ - y₁) / (x₂ - x₁)\n\n3. **Substitute the values:**\n   - m = (8 - 2) / (4 - 1)\n\n4. **Calculate the differences:**\n   - m = (6) / (3)\n\n5. **Simplify the fraction:**\n   - m = 2\n\n## Example\nThe slope between points (0, 1) and (3, 7) is (7-1)/(3-0) = 6/3 = 2.\n\n## Summary\nThe slope of the line passing through (1, 2) and (4, 8) is 2."}
{"prompt": "What is the sum of the interior angles of a hexagon?", "completion": "## Overview\nThis problem requires knowing the formula for the sum of the interior angles of any polygon.\n\n## Key Concepts\n- A polygon with n sides has n interior angles.\n- The sum of the interior angles of an n-sided polygon is given by the formula: (n - 2) × 180°.\n- A hexagon is a polygon with 6 sides.\n\n## Step-by-Step Explanation\n1. **Identify the number of sides (n):** For a hexagon, n = 6.\n2. **Apply the formula for the sum of interior angles:**\n   - Sum = (n - 2) × 180°\n   - Sum = (6 - 2) × 180°\n3. **Perform the calculation:**\n   - (4) × 180° = 720°\n\n## Example\nThe sum of the interior angles of a quadrilateral (n=4) is (4-2)*180 = 2*180 = 360°.\n\n## Summary\nThe sum of the interior angles of a hexagon is 720 degrees."}
{"prompt": "Solve the inequality: 2x - 7 < 11", "completion": "## Overview\nThis is a linear inequality problem. We solve it similarly to an equation, but must be careful with the inequality sign when multiplying or dividing by negative numbers.\n\n## Key Concepts\n- Solving inequalities follows the same basic principles as solving equations: perform the same operation on both sides.\n- The inequality sign reverses when multiplying or dividing both sides by a negative number.\n- The solution represents a range of values, not just a single number.\n\n## Step-by-Step Explanation\n1. **Start with the given inequality:** 2x - 7 < 11\n2. **Isolate the term with the variable by adding 7 to both sides:**\n   - 2x - 7 + 7 < 11 + 7\n   - 2x < 18\n3. **Solve for x by dividing both sides by 2:**\n   - (2x)/2 < 18/2\n   - x < 9\n4. **Since we divided by a positive number (2), the inequality sign does not reverse.**\n\n## Example\nSolving 3x + 5 ≥ 20: Subtract 5: 3x ≥ 15. Divide by 3: x ≥ 5.\n\n## Summary\nThe solution to the inequality 2x - 7 < 11 is x < 9, meaning all real numbers less than 9 satisfy the inequality."}
